# My-projects
Here is some projects that i've done. They're easy but it can show my skills.
In projects im using cocoapods, im working with network in *BitcoinTicker* and *Clima* and parsing JSON, as well as using data persist protocol "Codable" in *PushNotificationsSender* app and UserDefaults method. Also im working with Cloud database "Firebase" in *DoveChatApp* and *FlashChat* and local databases such as CoreData and REALM in *Todoey*. My first project that uses CoreML was *Hotdog app* it simply says is it hotdog on photo or not, like the app on "Silicon Valley" TV series. *Flowers Classificator* is an app that uses CoreML and pretrained model to classify flowers and wikipedia API to show some information about it.
## Dove Chat App
My first project was an instant messenger for bachelor’s degree. It was pretty hard. It has phone number autorization, push notifications and some more features.
